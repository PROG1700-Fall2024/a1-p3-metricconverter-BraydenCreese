#Program 3 â€“ Imperial to Metric Conversion

#Write a console program that converts a weight given in tons (imperial), stones, pounds, and ounces to the metric #equivalent in metric tons, kilograms, and grams. Begin by designing your solution to this problem in pseudocode, which will #be submitted along with the program.
#After the numbers of tons, stones, pounds, and ounces are input by the user, the weight should be converted entirely into #ounces (the lowest common denominator) and then divided by 35.274 to obtain the value in kilos. The Python int function #should be used to break the total number of kilos into a whole number of metric tons and kilos. The number of grams should #be displayed to one decimal place.
#Required formulas:
#total ounces = 35840 * tons + 224 * stone + 16 * pounds + ounces
#total kilos = total ounces / 35.274
#metric tons = Int(kilos/1000)
